# Analysing Netflix Data 

This is a datacamp project that uses a Netflix Dataset. The goal of this project is to answer the following questions;

Q1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s?

Q2. A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s

Besides DataCamp questions , I also used an LLM (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09) to generate some questions for me to answer. These were;

Q3. Which actors appear most frequently in Netflix content?

Q4. What are the characteristics of highly rated Netflix shows?
